    <h2>How we started</h2>
    <p>
      WinkedAndPolished started from a simple beginning — doing nails and lashes for friends and family at functions. 
      As more people appreciated the work and encouraged the idea, the passion naturally grew into a business. 
      What began as a fun way to help others feel confident soon turned into a dream to offer professional, 
      luxurious beauty services to the wider community. Today, we continue that same personal touch with every client we serve.

      <h2>Nails</h2>
      <p>
        From classic manicures to intricate and personalized nail art, every service is delivered with precision, creativity, and a genuine love for the craft.
       Each set of nails is treated as a canvas, tailored to reflect your mood, style, or the special moment you're preparing for. Whether you’re going for a simple, 
       elegant finish or something bold and artistic, we focus on every detail to bring your vision to life. In addition to our nail services, we also offer custom-designed press-on nails 
       — perfect for those who want salon-quality looks with the convenience of applying them anytime, anywhere.

      <h2>Lashes</h2>
      <p>
        Enhancing natural beauty is at the heart of everything we do — and that includes lashes. Our lash services are all about adding volume, 
        length, and definition while keeping things lightweight and comfortable. Whether you're going for a soft, natural enhancement or a bold, 
        full-glam effect, each set is customized to suit your unique eye shape and personal style. We take great care in maintaining the health of your natural lashes, 
        using quality products and safe techniques to ensure stunning results that feel as good as they look.
